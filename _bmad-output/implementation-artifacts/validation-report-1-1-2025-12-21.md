## Improvements Applied

### 🚨 Critical Issues (Fixed)

| # | Issue | Resolution |
|---|-------|------------|
| 1 | Missing Functional Verification AC | Added **AC6** with fcitx5-diagnose verification |
| 2 | Missing Pre-requisite Check | Added **AC1** for environment validation |
| 3 | Socket Permission Not Enforced | Documented in constraints table (deferred to Story 1.2 per architecture) |

### ⚡ Enhancements (Applied)

| # | Enhancement | Resolution |
|---|-------------|------------|
| 1 | Pre-flight check commands | Added Task 0 with copy-paste commands |
| 2 | Post-compilation verification | Added Task 6 with fcitx5-diagnose steps |
| 3 | Warning flag guidance | Added `-Wall -Wextra` to cmake command |
| 4 | Rollback/troubleshooting | Added "故障排除" table with solutions |

### ✨ Optimizations (Applied)

| # | Optimization | Resolution |
|---|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Token efficiency | Condensed file manifest to single table |
| 2 | Task dependencies | Added parallelization hint at top of Tasks |
| 3 | Time estimates | Added ~Xmin estimates to each task |
| 4 | Reference consolidation | Moved to single footer line |

### 🤖 LLM Optimizations (Applied)

| # | Optimization | Resolution |
|---|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Code block verbosity | Reduced ydotool section to essentials |
| 2 | Actionable format | Each task now has verification command |
| 3 | Scannable structure | Added tables for constraints, troubleshooting |
| 4 | Inline references | Constraints table includes source column |

## Final Assessment

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Acceptance Criteria | 4 | 6 |
| Tasks | 5 | 7 (with Task 0 & Task 6) |
| Pre-flight Checks | ❌ | ✅ |
| Functional Verification | ❌ | ✅ |
| Troubleshooting Guide | ❌ | ✅ |
| Time Estimates | ❌ | ✅ |
| Parallelization Hints | ❌ | ✅ |

**Story is now fully optimized for LLM developer agent execution.**

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Must Fix:** All critical issues addressed
2. ✅ **Should Improve:** All enhancements applied
3. ⏳ **Consider (Future):** Socket permission enforcement should be explicit in Story 1.2
